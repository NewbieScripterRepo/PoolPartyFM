## ❤️ Motivation

Big fan of PoolSuite FM! Since there's no Android version, I'm creating my own with NativeScript & Vue. This project is a result of original tutorial series on NewbieScripter.com. Follow along to see my progress. Star the repository to don't miss any update,

## ⭐️ Highlights

- Works on Android!
- Built with NativeScript & Vue 3 💪
- Tried best to catch the vibe of original PoolSuite FM

## Branches

Each branch is a part of tutorial as I progress.
